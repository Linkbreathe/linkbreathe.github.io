### **Principles of Time Visualization**

#### **Understanding Time in Visualization**

- **Timescales:**
  - **Ordinal:** Events are in order but without quantifiable intervals.
    - ![image-20241101231440773](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101231440773.png)
  - **Discrete:** Specific, separate time points (e.g., timestamps).
    - ![image-20241101231457420](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101231457420.png)
  - **Continuous:** Time is measured on a continuous scale, allowing for interpolation.
    - ![image-20241101231523897](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101231523897.png)
- **Time Scope:**
  - **Time Points:** Values valid at specific moments.
    - ![image-20241101231842095](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101231842095.png)
  - **Time Intervals:** Values valid over a duration until the next measurement.
    - ![image-20241101231849418](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101231849418.png)
- **Time Arrangement:**
  - **Linear Time:** Chronological progression (past to future).
    - ![image-20241101232014387](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101232014387.png)
  - **Cyclic Time:** Repeating patterns (e.g., seasons, daily cycles).
    - ![image-20241101232023930](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101232023930.png)
  - **Branching Time:** Forking paths in time (e.g., version control systems: Git).
    - ![image-20241101232112673](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101232112673.png)
- **Time Granularity(粒度):**
  - ![image-20241101233259573](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101233259573.png)
  - Different levels of detail (seconds, minutes, days, months).
  - Multiple granularities can coexist, forming hierarchies like calendars.
  - it may make sense to have a visualization that supports this view on multiple granularity at the same time.

#### **Implications for Visualization**

- The combination of **timescale**, time **scope**, and **time arrangement influences** the choice of visualization techniques.
  - ![image-20241101233515686](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101233515686.png)
- Examples:
  - **Continuous Timescale with Time Points (Linear):** Line charts with time on the x-axis.
  - **Discrete Timescale with Time Intervals (Linear):** Bar charts showing durations.
  - **Continuous Timescale with Intervals (Gantt Charts):** Visualizing tasks or events over time.
- Can a continuous time scale (as on the left) and interval time scopes (as on the right) ever co-occur? If not, why? If so, how could a visualization for them look like?

### **Tasks on Time-Oriented Data Visualization**

- **Standard Tasks:**

  - Reading specific values
  - Identifying extremes or outliers
  - Finding clusters or patterns
  - Gauging distributions

- **Time-Specific Tasks:**

  - Analyzing data 

    behavior over time

    - **In Fluctuating Data** (**Heterogeneous -> 各種各樣的；混雜的**):

       **Look for regularities.**

      - **Trends:** General directions in data over time.
      - **Periodicities:** Repeating patterns at regular intervals.
      - **Sequences:** Specific orders of events.
      - ![image-20241101235916627](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101235916627.png)

    - In **Homogeneous(同类事物（或人）组成的；同类的；相似) Data** (**Predictable**):

       **Look for deviations.**

      - **Outliers:** Data points that differ significantly.
      - **Fluctuations:** Irregular changes or noise.
      - **Irregularities:** Unexpected sequences or missing patterns.
      - ![image-20241101235924472](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241101235924472.png)

### **Mapping Time to Visual Attributes**

#### **Using Visual Channels (Based on Mackinlay's Ranking)**

![image-20241102003436410](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241102003436410.png)

- **Position:** Most effective for representing time (e.g., x-axis in line charts).

- **Length:** Represents durations or intervals.

- **Angle:** Useful for cyclic time (e.g., clock faces, circular plots).

- **Connection:** Shows progression or sequence (e.g., connected scatter plots).

- **Size and Texture:** Can indicate temporal progression but less commonly used.

- Color:

  - **Luminance (Brightness):** Can represent time progression.

  - **Hue:** Generally not recommended for time due to **categorical perception**.

    - Ps:  **Hue** distinguishing it as red, blue, green defined by its position on the color wheel or by its dominant wavelength

  - we usually don't use color if we indicate um, or if we **equate temporal a temporal attribute with a quantitative**

    - **颜色的顺序性有限**：人类对颜色的感知并非线性，且颜色之间缺乏自然的顺序关系。因此，使用颜色表示时间序列可能导致对时间进程的误解。

      **颜色感知的主观性**：不同的人对颜色的感知可能存在差异，受文化、背景和个人经验等因素影响。这使得颜色在表示精确的时间信息时不够可靠。

      **色盲和视觉障碍**：约有8%的男性和0.5%的女性存在某种形式的色盲。使用颜色编码时间信息可能导致这些人群无法准确解读数据。

      **颜色数量的限制**：人类对颜色的区分能力有限，通常只能有效地区分有限数量的颜色。对于需要表示大量时间点的数据，颜色编码可能无法满足需求。

- **Shape:** **Not effective** for time; shape is an identity channel without inherent order.

### **Visualization Critiques**

#### **1. America's Religious Landscape Pie Chart**

- **Issues Identified:**
  - **Mixing Categories:** Combines religion and ethnicity inconsistently.**（EXPRESSIVENESS）**
  - **Incomplete Data:** Does not break down unaffiliated groups by ethnicity.**（EXPRESSIVENESS）**
  - **Percentages Don't Sum to 100%:** Likely due to rounding errors.**（EXPRESSIVENESS）**
  - In**effective** Use of Pie Chart:
    - Pie charts are not ideal for comparing complex hierarchical data. **（EFFECTIVENESS）**
  - Color Choices:
    - Not colorblind-friendly (issues with green and orange hues).**（EFFECTIVENESS）**
  - Ordering:
    - Segments are not consistently ordered by size or category.
- **Suggestions for Improvement:**
  - Use a Sunburst Chart:
    - Displays hierarchical data effectively.
    - Inner rings represent higher-level categories (religion), outer rings show subcategories (ethnicity).
      - ![image-20241102021804920](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241102021804920.png)
  - Separate Charts:
    - Provide individual charts for religion and ethnicity to avoid confusion.
  - Correct Percentages:
    - Ensure percentages add up to 100% by adjusting rounding or displaying decimals.
  - Improve Color Scheme:
    - Use colorblind-friendly palettes.
    - Avoid implying order where none exists.

#### **2. Bivariate Map of Wisconsin**

- **Issues Identified:**
  - Lack of **Normalization**:
    - Bubble sizes represent the absolute number of+ high school graduates, not accounting for population differences.
    - Larger counties appear to have more graduates simply due to higher population.
  - Incorrect Bubble Scaling:
    - Bubbles are scaled by diameter instead of area, exaggerating differences. -> **lie factor**
  - Inconsistent Binning:
    - Household income categories in the choropleth map are unevenly binned without clear reasoning.
  - Poor Bubble Placement:
    - Overlapping bubbles and misalignment with county boundaries.
- **Suggestions for Improvement:**
  - Normalize Data:
    - Use percentages (e.g., proportion of residents with high school degrees) to allow meaningful comparisons.
  - Correct Bubble Scaling:
    - Scale bubbles based on area to accurately represent data.
  - Consistent Binning:
    - Use equal intervals or quantiles for income categories.
    - Provide clear explanations for chosen binning methods.
  - Improve Visual Clarity:
    - Adjust bubble placement to reduce overlap.
    - Consider alternative visualization techniques, such as proportional symbols or graduated color maps.
