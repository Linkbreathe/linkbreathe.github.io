## Geo-visualization

### Introduction

- **Origin of Visualization**: Geo-visualization, or **thematic** cartography(专题制图), is considered the origin of visualization.
- **Fundamentals**: Many **visualization principles**, such as the use of marks (points, lines, areas), **stem from cartography**.
- **Importance**: Understanding geovisualization is crucial due to its widespread application and foundational concepts.

### Challenges in Geo-visualization

#### Misrepresentation in Maps

- **Example**: The Mercator projection distorts areas, making regions near the poles appear larger.
- **Consequence**: Can lead to misconceptions about the size and importance of different regions.

#### Election Maps and the Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP)

- **Issue**: Traditional election maps may **misrepresent** data due to varying area **sizes of regions**.
- **Example**: A large area with a small population may appear more significant than it is.
- **Solution**: Use cartograms or other visualization techniques that adjust for population or electoral influence.

## Map Projections

### Purpose of Map Projections

- **Challenge**: Representing the 3D Earth on a 2D map introduces distortions.
- **Types of Distortions**: Area, shape (angles), and distance.

### Common Map Projections

#### Mercator Projection

- Characteristics:
  - Preserves **angles** (conformal).
  - Distorts **areas**, especially near the **poles**.
  - **angle**（角度）指的是**地球表面上两条相交线之间的夹角**
  - 当地图投影被称为**conformal**（保角投影）时，意味着它在局部范围内保持了这些角度的准确性。
  - ![球极投影（2）：保圆性和保角性 - 知乎](https://pic3.zhimg.com/v2-6876cfd6d5d01c562dbac93e58ad2312_r.jpg)
- Use Cases:
  - Nautical **navigation**: Straight lines on the map correspond to constant compass bearings.
  - **Online maps** (e.g., Google Maps) for local navigation.

#### Mollweide Projection

- Characteristics:
  - **Preserves area** (equal-area).
  - Distorts shapes, especially at the edges.
- **Use Cases**: Representing **global distributions** where area **accuracy** is **important**.

![image-20241108180240200](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241108180240200.png)

#### Azimuthal Equidistant Projection

- Characteristics:
  - Preserves distances from a central point.
  - Distorts areas and shapes elsewhere.
- **Use Cases**: Radio and seismic mapping from a specific location.

### Evaluating Projections with Tissot's Indicatrices

- **Technique**: Placing identical circles on the globe to visualize distortions when projected onto a map.
- Interpretation:
  - **Size Changes**: Indicates **area distortion.**
  - **Shape Changes**: Indicates **angular distortion.**

![image-20241108182843501](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241108182843501.png)

### Quality Criteria for Map Projections

1. **Angle Preservation (Conformal)**: Shapes of small areas are preserved.
2. **Area Preservation (Equal-Area)**: Relative sizes of areas are maintained.
3. **Distance Preservation (Equidistant)**: Distances from a central point are accurate.

- **Note**: It's **impossible to preserve all three simultaneously**; projections must compromise based on use case.

![image-20241108191623517](https://linkingblog.oss-eu-central-1.aliyuncs.com/image-20241108191623517.png)

#### Issues Identified

- **Distorted Time Axis**:
  - Only plotted dates when polls were taken, leading to uneven time intervals.
  - Misrepresents the duration of trends.
- **Color Usage**:
  - Not colorblind-safe; red and green used together.
  - Insufficient distinction between colors for different candidates.
- **Missing Labels**:
  - One of the candidate lines is not labeled, causing confusion.

#### Recommendations

- **Time Axis Correction**:
  - Use a continuous time axis with interpolation between polling dates.
- **Colorblind-Friendly Palette**:
  - Implement color schemes that are distinguishable for all viewers (e.g., ColorBrewer palettes).
- **Labeling**:
  - Ensure all data series are properly labeled.
  - Consider highlighting remaining candidates and de-emphasizing those who have dropped out.
- **Alternative Visualization**:
  - Explore using stacked area charts to represent voter percentages summing to 100%.
  - Use small multiples or separate charts for clarity if necessary.
