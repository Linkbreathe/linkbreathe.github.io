Welcome to the second week of our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course. Today, we'll delve into the practical aspects of human interaction, focusing on input and output devices. By the end of this lecture, you should understand:

- **Input devices** in terms of absolute and relative input, position, and rate control.
- How to **classify input devices**.
- An overview of **display technologies** and other output technologies.

## Introduction to Input and Output Devices

Input and output devices form the bridge between humans and computers. They are essential for:

- **Modifying** the contents of a computer system (input).
- **Conveying** the state of the computer to the user (output).

------

## Input Devices

According to Bill Buxton, an input device is a **transducer from the physical properties of the world to the logical parameters of a computer system**.

### Common Input Devices

- **Keyboards and Keypads**: Traditional text entry devices.
- **Pointing Devices**: Manipulate and select objects in a graphical display.
- **Physical Controls**: Buttons, knobs, and sliders for specific functions.
- **Contactless Input**: Voice interaction, facial expressions, and gestures.

### Examples and Key Points

#### **Historical Evolution of Input Devices**

- **Light Pens (1960s)**: Early direct interaction devices used on screens.

- Computer Mouse (1964)
  : Invented by Douglas Engelbart.

  - Introduced during "The Mother of All Demos" in the 1970s.
  - Demonstrated alongside keyboards, graphical interfaces, networking, and touchscreens.

- **Keyboards (1970s)**: Became standard input devices, derived from typewriters.

- **Digital Joysticks (1977)**: First introduced by Atari for gaming.

- **Touchpads (1990s)**: Common in laptops for cursor control.

- **Smartphones (2007 onwards)**: Touchscreens became ubiquitous.

- **Voice Input (2010s)**: Emergence of Siri, Google Assistant, and others.

- **Eye Tracking and Neural Interfaces (Recent)**: Technologies like Tobii Eye Tracking and Neuralink.

#### **Keyboards and Text Entry**

- QWERTY Layout:
  - Most common keyboard layout.
  - **Myth**: Designed to prevent typewriter jams by spacing out common letters.
  - **Reality**: A practical and efficient layout for typing.
- Dvorak Layout:
  - Designed for efficiency by placing common letters on the home row.
  - **Myth**: Significantly increases typing speed.
  - **Reality**: With training, typists can be equally efficient on both layouts.
- Projected Keyboards:
  - **Advantages**: Portability and space-saving.
  - **Disadvantages**: Lack of tactile feedback; no proprioceptive cues.
  - **Example**: Virtual keyboards on smartphones—while ubiquitous, they lack the tactile feel of physical keys.
- Split and Chorded Keyboards:
  - **Split Keyboards**: Ergonomic but lack standardization.
  - Twiddler (Chorded Keyboard):
    - Portable and wearable.
    - Requires memorizing combinations of key presses.
    - **Challenge**: Difficult to learn and retain proficiency.

#### **Pointing Devices**

- Mouse:
  - Invented by Douglas Engelbart.
  - A **relative pointing device**—movement translates to cursor movement on the screen.
  - **Components**: Buttons for clicking, scroll wheel for navigation.
- Touchpad:
  - Found on laptops.
  - Supports gestures like two-finger scrolling.
  - Relative vs. Absolute:
    - Typically relative, but can function as absolute if mapped directly to the screen.
- Light Pen:
  - Early direct pointing device.
  - **Absolute control** by pointing directly at screen elements.
  - Connected via a cord; not wireless.
- Touchscreen:
  - **Absolute pointing device**.
  - Types:
    - Resistive Touchscreens:
      - Two layers that detect touch when pressed together.
      - **Advantages**: Cost-effective, accurate.
      - **Disadvantages**: Limited to single touch.
    - Capacitive Touchscreens:
      - Detect touch via the conductive properties of the human finger.
      - **Advantages**: Supports multitouch (pinch, zoom).
      - **Disadvantages**: Requires conductive touch (cannot use with regular gloves).
    - Optical Sensing Touchscreens:
      - Use cameras to detect touch and gestures.
      - Used in large tabletop displays.

## Hard Controls vs. Soft Controls

### **Hard Controls (Physical Controls)**

- Provide tactile feedback.
- Users can operate them without visual attention.
- Examples:
  - Traditional car dashboards with physical buttons and knobs.
  - Flight simulators with physical joysticks and throttles (HOTAS systems).

### **Soft Controls (Software-Based Controls)**

- Displayed on screens; can be reconfigured via software updates.
- Advantages:
  - Flexibility and customization.
  - Easier to update and add new features.
- Disadvantages:
  - Lack of tactile feedback.
  - May require visual attention to operate.
- Examples:
  - Modern car interfaces like Tesla's touchscreen dashboard.

### **Discussion Points**

- Trade-offs:
  - **Safety**: Physical controls are preferred for critical functions (e.g., steering, braking).
  - **Usability**: Soft controls offer versatility but may distract the user.
- Immersion and Realism:
  - Physical controls enhance user experience in simulations and gaming.
  - **Example**: Flight simulators using physical flight sticks and throttles provide more precision and realism.

## Detailed Analysis of Input Devices

### Physical Properties

- **Linear Input**: Moving devices along an axis (e.g., mouse movement).
- **Rotary Input**: Rotating devices (e.g., volume knobs, scroll wheels).

### Control Types

- Position Control:
  - **Absolute**: Direct mapping to a position (e.g., touchscreens).
  - **Relative**: Movement relative to the starting point (e.g., mouse).
- Force Control:
  - **Isometric Controllers**: Do not move but sense the force applied (e.g., ThinkPad's pointing stick, F-16 joystick).
  - **Isotonic Controllers**: Move freely; position corresponds to input (e.g., standard joystick).
  - **Elastic Controllers**: Return to a neutral position when released (e.g., game controllers).

### Degrees of Freedom (DoF)

- **1 DoF**: Single-axis controls (e.g., volume sliders).
- **2 DoF**: Two-dimensional controls (e.g., mouse, touchpad).
- **3 DoF**: Adds depth or rotation.
- **6 DoF**: Position and orientation in 3D space (e.g., Wii controller).

### **Order of Control**

- Zero-Order Control: Input directly controls position.
  - **Example**: Mouse movement translates to cursor position.
- First-Order Control: Input controls velocity (rate of change).
  - Example: Controlling the speed of a tank turret in "Gunner Heat PC" game.
    - Movement speed is controlled rather than direct position.
