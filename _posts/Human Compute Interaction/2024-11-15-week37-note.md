## HCI Lecture Notes: Graphical User Interfaces

## Introduction

In last week's lecture, Nicholas discussed the hardware of user interfaces, focusing on **input devices** and **output devices**. Today, we delve further into the computer to explore **graphical user interfaces (GUIs)**.

On the first slide, the professor displayed two interfaces:

- **Right**: The **Apple Vision Pro** interface, which we discussed on the first day.
- **Left**: An interface from the **Xerox Star** computer, one of the first GUIs developed at Xerox PARC before Windows and macOS. This interface was the inspiration for many of today's GUIs.

**Key Point**: Despite the decades between them, both interfaces prominently feature **windows** and **icons**, demonstrating that these ideas have enduring relevance in GUI design.

## Overview

1. **Different Types of Graphical User Interfaces**
2. **Components of Typical GUIs**
3. **Command-Line Interfaces**
4. **Direct Manipulation**
5. **Interaction Techniques**
6. **Interaction Tasks**
7. **Modes in User Interfaces**

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:

- Understand various types of GUIs.
- Identify the components that make up typical GUIs.
- Discuss the role and design considerations of command-line interfaces.
- Explain the concept and characteristics of direct manipulation.
- Describe different interaction techniques and tasks.
- Understand the concept of modes and their impact on user interfaces.

## Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs)

### Personal Experience with CLIs

The professor shared his first experience with computer interfaces:

- **Atari PC3** in the mid-80s.
- Featured a **16-color EGA screen**.
- Ran an early variant of **MS-DOS**.
- Used **QDOS**, a simple GUI for navigating the file system.
- For running and installing games, he used the **command-line interface** at the top of the screen.

### Modern Use of CLIs

Even today, CLIs are widely used, especially among power users and developers:

- **Terminal** on macOS.
- **Command Prompt** or **PowerShell** on Windows.
- **JavaScript Console** in web browsers.
- CLIs in games, such as **King's Quest**, where commands are typed to interact with the game world.

**Exercise**: The professor asked how many students had used a terminal in the last day or week. Most had, indicating the continued relevance of CLIs.

### Strengths of CLIs

- **Simplicity**: Easier and cheaper to create than complex GUIs.
- **Power and Flexibility**: Capable of handling complex tasks with numerous parameters.
- **Scripting and Automation**: Users can create scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
- **Efficiency for Experienced Users**: Command history and shortcuts speed up workflows.

### Weaknesses of CLIs

- **Lack of Intuitiveness**: Not user-friendly for beginners.
- **Memorization Required**: Users must remember commands and their parameters.
- **Limited Feedback**: Difficult to know if the system is processing commands as intended.
- **Error-Prone**: Small mistakes can lead to significant errors.

### Design Considerations for CLIs

- **Availability**: How does the user know which commands are available?
- **Naming**: How does the user know the names of the commands the system
understands?
- **Learning**: How does the user learn the semantics of commands and their parameters
- **Recall**: Recall: How does the system support the user in recalling commands?
- **Syntax**: How does the user know what parameters to expect and their form?
- **Transparency**: How does the system provide feedback to the user about correct and
erroneous commands?

## Direct Manipulation

### Definition and Characteristics
Shneiderman 1983

**Direct Manipulation** involves interacting with digital objects as if they were physical objects, allowing users to manipulate them directly.

Key characteristics:

1. **Continuous Representation**: Objects of interest are continuously visible on the screen.
2. **Physical Actions**: Users perform actions directly on objects rather than using complex syntax.
3. **Incremental and Reversible Actions**: Users perform small actions that can be easily undone.
4. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see the effects of their actions immediately.
5. **Progressive Learning**: Users can learn by exploring and experimenting without reading manuals.

### Examples of Direct Manipulation

1. **Blender 3D Modeling Software**:
   - Users can manipulate objects like cubes directly by moving, scaling, or rotating them.
   - Immediate visual feedback and reversible actions enhance user experience.
2. **File Management**:
   - Dragging a file to the trash bin to delete it.
   - Provides visual feedback during the action (e.g., the file icon moves with the cursor).

### Degrees of Directness

- **Weak Direct Manipulation**: Requires intermediary steps, such as using menus or dialog boxes.
- **Strong Direct Manipulation**: Users interact with objects directly using handles or gestures.
- **Immersive Manipulation**: Involves virtual or augmented reality, where physical actions correspond closely to digital effects.

**Example**: A video demonstrated increasing levels of direct manipulation, from using menus to manipulating objects directly with handles, and finally combining both for optimal efficiency.

## Interaction Techniques

### Definition

“An **interaction technique** is a computation that couples input and output, to support elementary interactive tasks.“

Or say an **interaction technique** is a method that translates user input into system responses, coupling input and output to support basic interactive tasks.

### Types of Interaction Techniques

- **Pointing Techniques**: Moving a cursor or pointer to interact with objects.
- **Selection Techniques**: Selecting objects or options from a set.
- **Text Number and Text**: Inputting text using keyboards, touchscreens, or voice input.
- **Camera Control Techniques**: Navigating through 3D environments.

### Objectives in Designing Interaction Techniques

### Examples of Interaction Techniques

1. **OctoPocus**:
   - A gestural guidance system that helps users learn and execute gestures.
   - Provides dynamic visual feedback, showing possible gestures and their effects.
2. **Imaginary Keyboard for AR Headsets**:
   - Enables hands-free text entry using an "imaginary" keyboard overlaid in augmented reality.
   - Evaluated different selection mechanisms to address challenges like arm fatigue and visual occlusion.

### Evaluation of interaction techniques

- Interaction techniques are evaluated empirically
- Typically through controlled experiments for equivalent tasks
  - E.g., iText vs. Heads-up keyboard or OctoPocus vs. Marking Menu
- Three main considerations
  - Isolating the effect of the technique from other factors
  - Estimating real-world user performance
  - Demonstrating progress over previous solutions 

## Interaction Tasks

### Definition

An **interaction task** is an action performed by the user to achieve a goal within the system.

### Types of Interaction Tasks (pdf 31)

1. **Input Tasks**:
   - **Text Input**: Using text fields, keyboards, or voice input.
   - **Value Input**: Using sliders or number fields.
   - **Position Input**: Selecting positions on a screen or canvas.
   - **Path Input**: Drawing paths or gestures.
2. **Selection Tasks**:
   - **Single Selection**: Choosing one item from a selection set(radio set).
   - **Multiple Selection**: Choosing multiple items, often using modifiers like Ctrl or Shift keys.
   - **Menu Selection**: Navigating hierarchical menus.
3. **Trigger Tasks**:
   - **Buttons and Controls**: Clicking buttons to initiate actions.
   - **Gestures**: Using gestures to execute commands.
   - **Drag-and-Drop**: Moving objects to trigger operations.
4. **Navigation Tasks**:
   - **Scrolling**: Moving through content vertically or horizontally.
   - **Panning and Zooming**: Navigating within larger content areas or maps.
5. **Property Specification Tasks**:
   - **Dialog Boxes**: Setting properties through input fields.
   - **Inspectors**: Adjusting properties of selected objects.
6. **Transformation Tasks**:
   - **Resizing**: Changing the size of objects using handles.
   - **Rotating**: Adjusting the orientation of objects.
   - **Moving**: Changing the position of objects on the screen.

### Menus in Interaction Tasks

- **Linear Menus**: Traditional drop-down menus.
- **Pie Menus**: Radial menus that can be faster due to equal distance to options.
- **Marking Menus**:
  - Combine gestures with menu selection.
  - Enable rapid command execution after learning the gesture paths.

**Example**: A demonstration showed that marking menus could be up to ten times faster than linear menus but may have limitations in scalability and learnability.

## Modes in User Interfaces

### Definition

A **mode** is a state of the interface in which the same user actions produce different results.

### Types of Modes

1. **Temporal Modes**: Modes that change over time or based on system state (e.g., video playback controls).
   1. The same user action performed at different times has different effects
   2. Problem: Initiative of the mode change 
2. **Spatial Modes**: Modes that change based on the location of interaction (e.g., dropping a file onto different areas resulting in different actions).
   1. The same user action performed at different locations has different effects
3. **Quasimodes**: Modes that are active only while a physical control is engaged (e.g., holding down a key).
   1. Temporal modes activated as long as a physical action is sustained

### Examples and Issues

- **Caps Lock**: Changes typing from lowercase to uppercase.
- **Tool Palettes in Graphic Editors**: Switching between drawing, selecting, or erasing tools.
- **Mode Errors**: Occur when users are unaware of the current mode and perform unintended actions.

**Design Challenge**: Modes can increase cognitive load and lead to errors, so designers must carefully consider their implementation.

### Case Study: VI vs. Emacs Editors

**VI Editor**:

- **Modes**: Has distinct modes (command mode and insert mode).
- **Usage**: Users switch between modes to edit text or execute commands.

**Emacs Editor**:

- **Modality**: Less reliant on modes, using key combinations instead.
- **Usage**: Commands are executed using modifier keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt).

**Activity**: The professor encouraged students to try writing a file in both editors to experience the different approaches to modes.

## Conclusion

Understanding the design and implementation of graphical user interfaces is crucial for creating effective and user-friendly systems. By exploring command-line interfaces, direct manipulation, interaction techniques and tasks, and the role of modes, we gain insights into how users interact with technology and how we can enhance those interactions.
